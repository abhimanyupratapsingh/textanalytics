Sampling and Confidence Intervals: I have a deep understanding of statistical sampling methods, leveraging confidence intervals to ensure robust estimates when working with large text corpora. This includes determining sample sizes, margin of error, and applying statistical inference to text datasets.

N-gram Analysis: I specialize in using n-gram models to capture word sequences and their relationships within text data. This technique helps in building more accurate language models, improving tasks such as sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and text classification.

Statistical Contextualization (SCF): I utilize Statistical Contextual Features (SCF) to uncover hidden patterns and relationships within text. By examining statistical features of words and phrases, I extract meaningful insights that improve downstream machine learning models and analytics tasks.

Bag of Words (BoW) Model: I work with the BoW model to convert text into a structured form suitable for machine learning tasks. This involves transforming raw text into a matrix of token counts or term frequencies, which can be further processed for classification, clustering, or prediction.

Feature Extraction: I have extensive experience in feature extraction from text data, employing both traditional methods (like TF-IDF) and more advanced approaches (such as word embeddings and sentence vectors) to convert textual data into meaningful numeric features for machine learning models.

Article Scraping & Web Scraping: I have expertise in scraping articles, blogs, and other text-rich content from websites. I use web scraping tools to collect data, ensuring that it is cleaned, structured, and pre-processed for further analysis.

Data Preprocessing: I am proficient in text preprocessing techniques such as tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, stopword removal, and text normalization. I ensure that the text data is clean, consistent, and ready for modeling, which includes handling missing values, outliers, and noisy data.
